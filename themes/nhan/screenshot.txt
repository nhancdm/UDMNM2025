NHAN THEME SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER

To complete your theme, you should create a screenshot.png file (1200x900 pixels) 
that shows a preview of your theme. This image will be displayed in the WordPress 
admin area under Appearance > Themes.

Recommended screenshot specifications:
- File name: screenshot.png
- Dimensions: 1200 x 900 pixels
- File format: PNG
- File size: Under 1MB

The screenshot should show:
- Header with site title and navigation
- Main content area with sample post
- Sidebar with widgets
- Footer area

You can create this screenshot by:
1. Setting up your theme with sample content
2. Taking a screenshot of the homepage
3. Cropping it to 1200x900 pixels
4. Saving as screenshot.png in the theme root directory

This will make your theme look professional in the WordPress theme selector.
